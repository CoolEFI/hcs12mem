hc12mem 1.1 (2005.11.17)

- support for Freescale's LRAE (Load RAM And Execute) bootloader,
  see Application Note AN2546 from Freescale.
  LRAE currently can erase, read and write FLASH memory, with option to leave
  or erase LRAE itself
- support for much more chips - almost every HCS12 MCU is supported,
  but not all are tested, though. Especially parts with multiple FLASH
  blocks were not tested yet
- resolved some problems with serial port timing under unix systems
- changed option -V for --verify into -v
- included S-record files for target loadable RAM agents, so no more
  requirement for GNU gcc for hc11/12 for installation from sources

hc12mem 1.0 (2005.11.08)

  improved version of PODEX
- supported targets: MC9S12A64, MC9S12NE64
- tested under FreeBSD, GNU/linux and MS Windows
