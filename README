hc12mem is a command line tool for reading/writing HCS12 MCU memories.

Installation:

tar -xzf <hc12mem-x.x.tar.gz>
cd hc12mem-x.x
./configure
make
su
make install

Under FreeBSD, use gmake instead of make.

For successful compilation, installation of GNU gcc for HC11/HC12 is required,
because target agents are build from sources.

For usage help, see `man hc12mem`
