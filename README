hc12mem is a command line tool for reading/writing HCS12 MCU memories.

Communication with target device:
* BDM - Background Debug Module, via special interface called BDM POD
  Currently supported ones are:
  - Daniel Malik's TBDML
  - Kevin Ross's BDM12POD
  - Parek Peca's PODEX
  - my own improved version of PODEX
* LRAE - Freescale's bootloader, connection via serial port (see Freescale's
  Application Note AN2546)
* Freescale's serial monitor, connection via serial port (see Freescale's
  Application Note AN2548)

Supported MCUs: common prefix is <MC9S12>
A32, A64, A128, A256, A512,
C32, C64, C96, C128,
GC16, GC32, GC64, GC96, GC128,
D32, D64, D128, D256, D512,
E32, E64, E128, E256,
H128, H256,
UF32,
NE64.

Installation:

tar -xzf <hc12mem-x.x.tar.gz>
cd hc12mem-x.x
./configure
make
su
make install

Under FreeBSD, use gmake instead of make.

For successful compilation, installation of GNU gcc for HC11/HC12 is not
required anymore, because target agents are included in S-record files form.

Using TBDML as target interface requires installation of libusb.

For usage help, see `man hc12mem`
