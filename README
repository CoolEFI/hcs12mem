hcs12mem is a command line tool for reading/writing Freescale S12 MCU memories.

Communication with target device:
* BDM - Background Debug Module, via special interface called BDM POD
  Currently supported ones are:
  - Daniel Malik's TBDML
  - Kevin Ross's BDM12POD
  - Parek Peca's PODEX
  - my own improved version of PODEX
* LRAE - Freescale's bootloader, connection via serial port (see Freescale's
  Application Note AN2546)
* Freescale's serial monitor, connection via serial port (see Freescale's
  Application Note AN2548)

Supported MCUs: common prefix is <MC9S12>
A32, A64, A128, A256, A512,
C32, C64, C96, C128,
GC16, GC32, GC64, GC96, GC128,
D32, D64, D128, D256, D512,
E32, E64, E128, E256,
H128, H256,
UF32,
NE64,
XDP512,
XEP100,
XS128.

-----

To use with MCUs other that the XEP100 and XS128, you have to edit src/hcs12mcu.h and change line 83 to:
#define HCS12_IO_PPAGE 0x0030 // For XDP512 and C64/C128 = 0x0030

Andy added support for XEP100 and XS128 MCUs, I already edited src/hcs12mcu.h and changed line 83 to:
#define HCS12_IO_PPAGE 0x0015 // For XEP100 and XS128 = 0x0015

Then follow the Installation steps.

Installation:

  Linux:
    cd hcs12mem
    ./configure
    make
    su
    make install

  Under FreeBSD, use gmake instead of make.

  To compile/use with Windows you will need Cygwin with autogen, automake, configure, gcc and make packages installed.

  Windows/Cygwin terminal:
    cd hcs12mem
    bash autogen
    bash configure
    make
    make install

Usage:
To export the memory contents in Linux:
  1. Plug in the MCU to a serial port or USB to serial adapter.
  2. Open a terminal window.
  3. To find the communications port type: ls /dev | grep tty
  4. It should show you something like:
        $ ls /dev | grep tty
        tty
        ttyS8     {this is a serial port}
        ttyUSB0   {this is a usb to serial port}
   5. To export the contents of the flash memory type:
      ./hcs12mem.exe -p /dev/ttyS8 -b 115200 -i sm -t mc9s12xep100 -a banked-ppage --flash-read xep100.export.ppage.s19


To export the memory contents in Windows/cygwin:
  1. Plug in the MCU to a serial port or USB to serial adapter.
  2. Open Cygwin Terminal.
  3. To find the communications port type: ls /dev | grep tty
  4. It should show you something like:
        $ ls /dev | grep tty
        tty
        ttyS8
   5. To export the contents of the flash memory type:
      ./hcs12mem.exe -p /dev/ttyS8 -b 115200 -i sm -t mc9s12xep100 -a banked-ppage --flash-read xep100.export.ppage.s19

-----

For successful compilation, installation of GNU gcc for HC11/HC12 is not
required anymore, because target agents are included in S-record files form.

Using TBDML as target interface requires installation of libusb.

For usage help, see `man hcs12mem`
